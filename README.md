# cloak-of-darkness

Cloak Of Darkness is a reprise of de facto "Hello, World" of interactive fiction.

Here is a source for a definition / requirements for a Cloak Of Darkness like clone:

http://www.firthworks.com/roger/cloak/

##How can I run this?

Requirements: node.js

```
npm install -g bower
```

Clone the code, open a terminal to the code then run 'bower install' to download the dependencies.

```
bower install
```

Install live-server

```
npm install -g live-server
```

Run live-server the index.html page will open in your browser.

##Status

Rooms and objects are there, you can move between rooms but not all of
the interactions have been completed yet. The code is just a very rough one off at the moment. I was less concerned about style as much as I was trying to get the core game written as quickly as possible.
