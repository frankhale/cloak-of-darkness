# cloak-of-darkness

Cloak Of Darkness is a reprise of de facto "Hello, World" of interactive fiction.

Here is a source for a definition / requirements for a Cloak Of Darkness like clone:

##How can I run this?

The easiest way is to install node.js, then install live-server via npm.

Clone the code, open a terminal to the code and then run live-server and the index.html page will open in your browser.

##Status

Rooms and objects are there, you can move between rooms but not all of
the interactions have been completed yet. The code is just a very rough one off at the moment. I was less concerned about style as much as I was trying to get the core game written as quickly as possible.
